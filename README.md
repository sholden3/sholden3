Hey everyone!

My name is Wes Holden, and I am currently a Data Scientist diving into the world of MicroServices. I am pretty passionate about web development on a whole,
but I am also a fan of graphics programming, and learning opengl and webgl.

I am currently spending my time learning about docker and containers in general, and how to create cloud native applications utilizing spring boot and angular/react.

Some projects I am currently creating is a way to develop plugins that users can upload to an app, and utilize to build their own TTRPG games and pages. I am utilizing
spring boot, Angular, and oauth 2.0 as a authorization framework, and JWT as the json payload. I am also using a JIT compiler, instead of the default AOT compiler in angular.
This allows for the compiling of the needed plugins when received.
